# WardhaMetroFLow
An AI-powered metro simulation for the city of Wardha. It offers two views: Passenger View to plan routes and get smart suggestions, and Admin View to monitor traffic, manage stations, and analyze predictions (helping visualize a smarter transit future).

# WardhaMetroFlow 🚇

WardhaMetroAI is an AI-powered metro simulation project built for the city of Wardha. It offers two interactive views:

- **Passenger View**: Plan metro routes, get real-time smart suggestions, and estimate arrival times.
- **Admin View**: Monitor metro traffic, manage stations, and analyze trends using predictive AI models.

This project envisions smarter, AI-driven public transit systems for emerging smart cities like Wardha.
